Useful extensions for sec-edgar-downloader.

## Install

``` sh
pip install sec_downloader
```

## Features

- Files are downloaded to a temporary folder, immediately read into
  memory, and then deleted.
- Use “glob” pattern to select which files are read to memory.

## How to use

Let’s demonstrate how to download a single file (latest 10-Q filing
details in HTML format) to memory.

``` python
from sec_downloader import Downloader

dl = Downloader("MyCompanyName", "email@example.com")
html = dl.get_latest_html("10-Q", "AAPL")
print(f"{html[:50]}...")
```

> **Note** The company name and email address are used to form a
> user-agent string that adheres to the SEC EDGAR’s fair access policy
> for programmatic downloading.

Which is implemented approximately as:

``` python
from sec_edgar_downloader import Downloader as SecEdgarDownloader
from sec_downloader import DownloadStorage

ONLY_HTML = "**/*.htm*"

storage = DownloadStorage(filter_pattern=ONLY_HTML)
with storage as path:
    dl = SecEdgarDownloader("MyCompanyName", "email@example.com", path)
    dl.get("10-Q", "AAPL", limit=1, download_details=True)
# all files are now deleted and only stored in memory

content = storage.get_file_contents()[0].content
print(f"{content[:50]}...")
```

    <?xml version="1.0" ?><!--XBRL Document Created wi...

Downloading multiple documents:

``` python
storage = DownloadStorage()
with storage as path:
    dl = SecEdgarDownloader("MyCompanyName", "email@example.com", path)
    dl.get("10-K", "GOOG", limit=2)
# all files are now deleted and only stored in memory

for path, content in storage.get_file_contents():
    print(f"Path: {path}\nContent [len={len(content)}]: {content[:30]}...\n")
```
